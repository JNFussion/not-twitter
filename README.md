# Not Twitter

This is the final project from [The odin project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/javascript-final-project).

## Description

The project consists in make a clone of a popular website. I chose Twitter.

My clone has the core functionality of Twitter:

- A Homepage where only logged users can access. Here you can post tweets, see your own's tweets and tweets from people that you are following.

- A profile page which is public. Here are displayed the user information (name, username, bio, location, user creation date), two counts with the followers and following. Also you can see your own tweets and tweets you had retweeted.

- A tweet page where you can see tweets responding to the first one.

- Ability to retweet and like tweets.

### Improvments

Posible improvements that can be made.

- Data validation, all forms need validation.
- Add trending section.
- Add ability to edit and remove tweets.
